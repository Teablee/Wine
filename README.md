<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Rainfall and temperature impact the wine rating from year-to-year.</p>
<br>
<h3> Current State</h3>
<p>Scoping datasets that will provide varietal, region, vintage(year), and rating. Looking to connect region with weather API for rainfall and temperature measurements.</p>
<br>
<h3>Nice to haves</h3>
<p>Granularity on region specifically lat, lon location of specific wine makers.</p>
<p>Quality measurements to define what 'impact' means (e.g. acidity, residual sugar, alcohol content, etc.)
